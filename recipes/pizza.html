    <h2>Italian Homemade Pizza</h2>
    <p>It’s easy to make this thin crust pizza dough recipe with a few ingredients you may likely already have on hand. Here’s what you’ll need: </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>

        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
